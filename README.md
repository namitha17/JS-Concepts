This is a sample TDD (via mocha and chai) on Node.js, for some JS-Concepts.
The tests run on through the Grunt task runner.

To use the tests, you will need to install Node -- you can do this via the
[download page](http://nodejs.org/#download) or using
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) if you are on a Mac.

Note that on Windows, there are some reports that you will need to restart
after installing Node

run:

    npm install
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    grunt develop

You can then view the tests in your browser on the mentioned port.
